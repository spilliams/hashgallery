Hashgallery starts with the assumption that a user does not have javascript enabled. It is meant to function at 95% without JS.
Once JS is turned on, navigation links become function calls and page redirection is handled by ajax requests and an added hash to the url (hence the name).

Set up your galleries of photos in folders. You may nest them.
Be aware that you may not have . # [ or ] as part of the image filenames.
Also note that only jpg, jpeg and png  are accepted.
If you want to include custom thumbnails, use the same filename except put "_thumb" at the end.

Once you have things where you want them, run the command `ruby generateHtml.rb' from the site directory. This script generates html pages for each of the galleries.

If you want to make changes and re-run the script, be aware that it does overwrite all html files it created.
A simple script for destroying ALL html files from the directory tree has also been included for convenience.
